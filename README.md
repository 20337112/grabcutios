# GrabCutIOS

## Overview
GrabCut is an image segmentation method based on graph cuts. The algorithm was designed by Carsten Rother, Vladimir Kolmogorov & Andrew Blake from Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK. in their paper, "GrabCut": interactive foreground extraction using iterated graph cuts . An algorithm was needed for foreground extraction with minimal user interaction, and the result was GrabCut.

## Usage

## Limitation
This program use OpenCV library.
It is too big to use for real service.(76.8MB)
So I'm going to implement the GrabCut Algorithm without OpenCV to reduce App size.

This algorithm is based on color value distribution. 
There is a limitation when foreground and background color are similar.
